## How to Play
1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. A word will be randomly chosen from the word list, and the game will start.
3. Guess letters one by one to uncover the hidden word.
4. Each incorrect guess will result in a hangman stage being displayed.
5. Guess the word before running out of lives to win the game.

## File Structure
- main.py: Main program.

## Customization
- Modify the word list in the code to include your own set of words.
- Adjust the number of lives or customize the hangman stages as desired.
