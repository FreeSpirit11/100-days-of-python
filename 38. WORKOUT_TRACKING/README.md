### Prerequisites
1. Install Python.
2. Obtain API keys from the Nutritionix API (APP_ID and API_KEY).
3. Acquire a token for accessing the Google Sheets API (TOKEN).
4. Set up the Google Sheets API (SHEET_ENDPOINT).
5. Define your gender, weight (in kg), height (in cm), and age.
6. Run the script and input your exercise details.

### Instructions
1. Replace the placeholders with your own API keys, token, and endpoints.
2. Modify the GENDER, WEIGHT_KG, HEIGHT_CM, and AGE with your personal information.
3. Execute the script and enter the exercise you did (e.g., "I did cycling today for two hours and yoga for one hour").
4. The script will log your exercise details along with calories and time to your Google Sheet.

### Note
- Ensure your API keys, tokens, and personal information are kept private and secure.
- The SHEET_ENDPOINT and EXERCISE_ENDPOINT URLs must be correctly set for the script to function.
