## Description

This project includes a Python script that simulates a higher-lower guessing game using data of various social media accounts stored in the `game_data.py` file.

## File Structure

- `game_data.py`: Contains data of various social media accounts.
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art used in the program.
- `main.py`: The main Python script for the Higher Lower Game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. The program will display two randomly selected social media accounts.
3. Guess which account has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
4. The program will inform you if your guess is correct or incorrect.
5. Keep playing to test your knowledge of social media followers.
