- Chrome Browser

You can install Selenium using pip:

pip install selenium
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.

3. Set the environment variables `PHONE_NUM` and `PASSWORD` with your Facebook login credentials to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
