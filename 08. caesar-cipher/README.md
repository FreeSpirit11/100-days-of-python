# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a Python program that encrypts and decrypts messages using a simple letter substitution technique. It shifts the letters of the message based on a specified shift amount.

## Features

- Supports encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) of messages.
- Allows customization of the shift amount to create unique encryption or decryption keys.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for inputting messages and shift amounts.
- Provides visual feedback with an ASCII art representation of the Caesar Cipher logo.

## How to Use

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. Choose whether to encode or decode a message.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Specify the shift amount to determine the encryption or decryption key.
5. The program will generate the resulting encoded or decoded message.

## Customization
- You can modify the alphabet list in the code to include additional characters or languages.
- Adjust the shift amount to create different encryption or decryption keys.

Feel free to modify the code or customize the encryption/decryption process based on your requirements and preferences.
