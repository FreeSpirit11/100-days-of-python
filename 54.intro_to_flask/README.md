# Introduction to Flask

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various concepts related to Flask, a lightweight web application framework. Below is a brief description of each script:

## first_class_objects.py

This script illustrates the properties of first-class objects, particularly functions, in programming languages like Python and JavaScript. It demonstrates how functions can be passed as arguments, nested within other functions, and returned from other functions.

## python_decorators.py

The `python_decorators.py` file showcases the concept of decorators in Python. It defines a decorator `my_decorator` that adds functionality before and after the execution of a given function. An example `say_hello` function is decorated with `my_decorator` to demonstrate its usage.

## hello.py

The `hello.py` script introduces Flask, a micro web framework for Python, by creating a simple web application. It defines routes for "/" and "/bye" endpoints, returning "Hello, World!" and "bye" respectively.

## exercise.py

The `exercise.py` file presents an exercise to create a decorator that calculates the execution time of a given function. It defines a `speed_calc_decorator` that measures the execution time of the decorated functions `fast_function` and `slow_function`.
